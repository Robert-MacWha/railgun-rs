- [x] Implement unshielding
- [x] Fix event tracker so it works with unshielding
- [x] Implement builder pattern for shields / transactions
- [x] Implement transfer
- [x] Create integration test that uses anvil for shield, balance check, unshield
- Implement PPOI
  - [x] Get POI for a shield note
  - [x] Get the TXID merkle tree
    - [x] Setup syncing to download TXID merkle tree from subsquid
    - [x] Verify the root against the poi API
- [ ] Fix the transact integration test
  - [ ] Generate POI proof inputs for a transfer operation
  - [ ] Send to a broadcaster
  - [ ] Send a POI for a transfer note 
- [ ] Implement broadcasters
- [ ] Refactor and tidy up
  - [ ] Pick and STICK WITH a consistent type for representing proof values / amounts. Right now I'm in conversion hell 
- Optimize performance
  - Benchmark current performance + components
  - [x] Try to use `https://github.com/philsippl/circom-witness-rs` for witness generation.  Seems to be ~30x faster for native, and probably faster for wasm too since we avoid wasmer overhead.
    - https://zkmopro.org/blog/circom-comparison/#witnesscalc
    - Will be very challenging since (a) I want this to be wasm32-wasip1 an (ideally) wasm32-unknown-unknown compatible, AND because I'll need to re-compile the circuits and they used an old version of circom. But if it works it'll be a significant performance improvement and properly cross-platform.
    - Alternatively, I know that `rust-witness` can work for native.  But I'm pretty sure the portable c it generates isn't compatible with wasm.
    - https://lib.rs/crates/circom-witnesscalc might work since it seems like it's a pure rust impl.  But idk if I'll be able to compile the circuits into its format. 
- Get working tested on WASM
  - Try switching to `https://github.com/iden3/circom-witnesscalc/tree/045320ecbafbff0617ab37eb6d85950ea8cc15ef`.  Need to fork it
  - to disable some C api stuff, but it might be possible?
- Implement native token support for shield / unshield
- Implement NFT support for shield / unshield / transfer
- Stop storing the private keys everywhere
